# Spotify Wrapped++

This web app uses the Spotify API to show you your top tracks and artists over various time intervals. It can also generate a playlist of your top tracks or a similar playlist based on your top tracks.

I used a React front-end and a Node/Express back-end. The authentication was taken directly from Spotify's documentation examples.
